An example of python library to encrypt your database.

* ~/crypt contains DET, HE and OPE decorators.
* ~/db contains some legacy code, which is useful when performing some tests
* ~/static is for bootstrap4
* ~/templates contains some html pages.

First of all install PostgreSQL and add some UDF from [here](https://github.com/salonkasoli/diploma/blob/master/help/postgre_foo.txt).
You need only my_avg_2 and my_state_2

Then install dependecies for python: flask, pyope and paillier

To start the app just call 
```
python server.py
```

Have fun, write back ;]
